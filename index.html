    <a href="http://www.xebia.com/scalalabs"><span class="title">On Tour in the Netherlands</span></a>
    This December we are taking the Scala Labs on the road with some live hands-on sessions around the Netherlands to reach out to our fellow Dutch developers who are interested in Scala. We will be doing a short introduction presentation but most of the focus will be on getting our hands dirty with some Scala labs.

    <span class="title">We are Ready to Roll !</span>
    Our self-imposed deadline is here and we think we have created enough labs and exercises for people to start playing with them, so from today we are officially live ! If you want some hands-on experience with Scala coding, hurry over to our <b><a href="getting-started.html">Getting Started</a></b> page and check out our labs.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  We have worked hard the last couple of weeks to bring you the first batch of labs. These latest labs are mostly focused on the absolute basics so they are a good place to start. The original, slightly more advanced labs that we developed for a company-internal course have been left mostly unchanged except for some polishing here and there. They are a good starting point if you have already read one of the Scala books or if you want to refresh your basics a bit by playing around with the Twitter API using Scala.
